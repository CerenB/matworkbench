# matworkbench
The matworkbench is an interface between Connectome Workbench and Matlab. Many neuroscience studies are using SPM for analyzing their data but it is somtimes difficult to track all the figures and regenerate them in the form that has been published. Connectome Workbench has the ability to keep track of all data but also difficult to intract with other softwares very quickly. Here I have a very small scripts which bridges the Matlab and Connectome Workbench that help scientist to check their data in the Connectome Workbench very quickly .

Prerequisites:

1) SPM12

2) Connectome Workbench

The current version has beeb tested in Linux and Mac
